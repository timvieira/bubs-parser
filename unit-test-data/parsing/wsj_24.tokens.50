The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation .
The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow .
The trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from July 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York .
Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index .
That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge .
Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow .
Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward .
`` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS .
A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted .
In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made .
`` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said .
Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .
Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS .
A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report .
The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August .
Robert H. Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level .
`` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said .
Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group .
He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .
He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units .
Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .

When research projects are curtailed due to government funding cuts , are we `` caught with our grants down '' ?

Assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms , American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain 's concept of both .
`` Capital City '' is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer , Thames Television .
The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987 .
Let 's make that 1929 , just to be sure .
According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million capital , `` follows the fortunes of a close-knit team of young , high-flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy .
But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... ''
You need n't be a high-powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .
The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives .
Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room , the yuppie dealers do little right .
Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week .
In the opening episode we learn that Michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch .
Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly .
Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone .
Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today .
Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy .
Ah , perfidious Columbia !
The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price .
So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second .
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds -LRB- since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays ? -RRB- .
Surprisingly , Shane Longman survives the week , only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation .
Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation , the executive 's internal rivals , led by a loutish American , demand his resignation .
